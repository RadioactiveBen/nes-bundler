## Assets needed for building
In order to build you need two files in this directory.
A build configuration-file and a ROM-file.

### Build configuration
A file named `build_configuration.json` looking something like this:
```json
{
    "window_title": "The title of the window, preferrably the name of your game"
}
```

### ROM-file
A file named `rom.nes` containing your actual game.
